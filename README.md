# Fractol

## Overview
A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc. Abstract fractals – such as the Mandelbrot Set – can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over

## Features

Multiple fractals : Mandelbrot, Julia, BurningShip.
Increase and decrease max iteration for shape calculation.
Zoom and unzoom.
Different colors patterns.

## How to use ?

```
$> make
$> ./fractol mandelbrot
$> For Julia Fractol select 2 starting values after writing (./fractol Julia) 
 ==> Sample usage: ./fractol julia -0.8 -0.15 (in this case : C = a + bi = -0.8 - 0.15i)
$> ./fractol burningship
```
